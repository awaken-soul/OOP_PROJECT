## Objective of Project : Enable users to request shipment of products, purchase of products and transportation services.
## Abstract : [Abstract](https://github.com/awaken-soul/OOP_PROJECT/blob/main/Document_Submission%5B1%5D/08_Abstract.txt)
## Problem Statement
The Aim of the system to help users with transportation and shipment service within a single sphere instead of relying on different platforms.
The Logistics and Delivery Management System is a project that manages order placement, shipment tracking, delivery scheduling, and warehouse inventory. 
It includes modules for users (admin, customer, delivery agent), vehicles, and orders with features like order status updates, route management, and billing.
The system simulates real-world logistics operations using Java classes, inheritance, and file/database handling.
## Scope of the project : 
## Functional Reuirements :
1. User Functions
   1. Request Delivery Agent for shipment of product from a certain pickup location to a destiantion.
   2. Request purchase of product from the available retailers
   3. Request Transportation facility
2. Delivery Agent Functions :
   1. Accept delivery/pickup request
3. Warehouse Functions and Retialers Function :
   1. Manage the products lsited inside
   2. Request delievry agents for delievring the product
4. Admin Functions :
   1. Moderate the system
   2. Check for retailer, warehouse and delivery agent validity.
## Tools and Technologies to be used : 
1. Swing for implementing the GUI
2. Sqlite for DBMS
3. JDBS for sqlite connectivity
4. Figma for UI Desgining
# Expected Output : 
A GUI platform with different user persona which includes User, Warehouse Manager, Retailers, Delivery Agent. The platform will implement options to perform the functionalites specified in the abstract. 
# Project Plan and timeline :

# Expected Deliverables
1. System design
2. Working GUI App (Swing)
3. User manual
4. Final project report
5. Presentation
